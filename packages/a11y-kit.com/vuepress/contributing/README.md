# Contributing

Contributing is welcome!  There are many components, utils, and systems that we can collectively build.  The more people helping, the more we can help!

If you'd like to help out, but don't have anything specific in mind, the [project board](https://github.com/a11y-kit/a11y-kit/projects/1)] is a great place to start.  This board lists acknowledged bugs, roadmap features, and general todos.  To make sure you aren't repeating work, comment on it to see if it's safe to work on.

::: tip
The labels `good first issue` and `bug` are great for getting started and having a meaningful impact.

The rest of the docs in this section can help you get started.

## New features / packages

You're welcome to work on something brand new!  If you'd like to, please create an issue first.  We'll discuss to make sure it fits in with the overall project.
