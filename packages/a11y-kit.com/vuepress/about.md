# About the project

a11y-kit is an attempt to provide accessible tooling for the modern web.  

Documentation on the project is a work in progress.  Feel free to help out at our [Github](https://github.com/a11y-kit/a11y-kit) monorepo, or take a look at the [available packages](./packages/).

## Browser Support

All packages in this project are built to the same levels of browser support.  They all will run in all modern browsers plus IE11.

::: tip
Many screenreader users are still using IE11.  See [the most recent WebAIM survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/).
:::

Most projects will have multiple builds that will allow you to strip out IE11 support if your site does not support IE11 anyways.  This is usually handled automatically by your bundler.
